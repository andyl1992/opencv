# Opencv 3.4.1 hololens UWP

This is the lastest opencv branch with edits to the cmake file to configure and generate a build suitbale for use on the microsoft hololens UWP. 

This was done in order to access the latest version of the dnn module specifically to carry out machine learning inference on the hololens. 

I have succesfully run this buid on the hololens and used the dnn module. 

The changes made were decided upon by viewing the commits of sylvain-prevosts.
